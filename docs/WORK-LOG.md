## 2026-11-09: 2026 visual redesign

**What changed:** new look across every page: floating glass menu, full-screen hero, oversized fluid type, photo bento grid, full-photo tour cards, swipeable tour rail, stacking evening chapters, WhatsApp message preview, split hero on tour pages, full-screen phone menu, floating booking bar.

**Why:** the operator felt the first version looked dated and asked for a current style that works on all screens.

**Paths:** `src/app/globals.css`, `src/components/layout`, `src/components/home`, `src/components/tours`, `src/components/ui/Rail.tsx`, `src/app`.

**Checks run:** 9 routes at 14 screen sizes from 320x568 to 3440x1440: no horizontal overflow or broken images. Hero text clear of the menu at 320x568 and 844x390. Phone booking flow opened WhatsApp with the right message. Scroll animations leave content fully visible. `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed.

**Delivery:** approved by the operator on the preview and pushed to `main`.

## 2026-11-09: new Ammar Tours website

**What changed:** new site on Next.js 16, React 19 and Tailwind 4 replacing the demo template. Pages: home, tours with category filter, 28 tour pages, about, contact, 404, sitemap and robots. Booking panel sends a prefilled WhatsApp message.

**Why:** the template had invented phone number, ratings, testimonials and a fake card checkout.

**Sources:** six tours, ratings and prices from the operator's GetYourGuide paste. Other tours and photos from ammartours.com. Contact details from the operator.

**Paths:** `src/data/tours.ts`, `src/data/site.ts`, `src/app`, `src/components`, `docs/REDESIGN-PLAN.md`.

**Checks run:** `tsc --noEmit` passed. `npm run lint` had one unused-import warning, since fixed. `npm run build` passed, 36 static pages, before that one-line fix. Browser run at 390, 820, 1180 and 1440 wide across 8 routes: no horizontal overflow, no broken images. Booking flow on desktop and phone opened WhatsApp with the right message.

**Delivery:** pushed to `main` and `redesign/ammar-tours` at 3b2f8c1 using a repo-only deploy key. A clean `npm ci`, type check, lint and build passed in the repo before the push. Vercel result not checked from here.
